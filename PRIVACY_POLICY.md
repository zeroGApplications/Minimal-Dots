# Privacy Policy for Minimal Dots

Hi, I am Raphael Kunert the creator of Minimal Dots.
This privacy policy is kind of pointless, as Minimal Dots does not collect any data.
It stores th users game state but does this locally and without accessing the users files.

Since you are here, this is the repository for Minimal Dots, which contains all of its source code.
It is also GNU V3 licensed.
(The app was build using Processing, any questions regarding the privacy policy of processing refer to `hello@processing.org` or `info@openprocessing.org`)

If you have any question regarding the privacy policy of Minimal Dots or anything else don't hesitate to write me an email:

`zerogapplications@gmail.com`

Yours sincerely,
Raphael Kunert
